# Your team should write a short report on your experience working on this project.   There is no hard word limit but as a guide, you should be writing around 2000-3000 words.	It should cover the following topics.

# Details of your deployment and where your application can be accessed (URL).

The website was deployed using Cloudflare service. We started off by going to the GitHub website, where we created a new repository, once we named the repository, we are able to access it through the GitHub Desktop app, through the desktop app we were able to clone the repository and upload all the files from our assignment repository to the new cloned repository, once that was done we were able to sign into Cloudflare, head to pages and deploy a new website. We were required to sign into the GitHub account, and then select our repository. Then the website was deployed and we were provided with a URL.
All files can be updated through the cloned repository named comp2110-group30
The URL: https://comp2110-group30.pages.dev/

# What you achieved: a short (few paragraphs) descriptions of what your group has implemented; highlight any extensions or additional work you did.

We were able to achieve multiple things during this assignment and while the work was hard it was great to look at our website in the end and be able to reflect on it, as it was a combined effort and we were able to share the sense of achievement together.

We first implemented the individual widgets, the first widget to be implemented was the weather widget by Alfarok Alrahmani, Alfarok was able to implement his widget by understanding the API and being able to use the list given to us to then pull the information regarding weather in Sydney Australia, he then went on further to implement a graphical improvement in the widget, by adding a graphic that correlates with the current weather, for example, a sun for sunny during the day, and a moon for clear skies during the night, same for rain and thunderstorms.

Then Samer Almasri implemented his widget of choice the random fact widget, and Samer was able to use what he learned during our tutorials to code the date and fetch data from the API, which he later implemented into his widget, during the assignment he also added a simple question mark image to the widget but we also found that it does take a little bit of time to load, so with that in mind we decided it will be best to remove it and keep the widget simple instead of us losing marks as we believed that the marker will take a simple look at the website and they might not wait for the image to load. 

Then Ali Issa implemented his widget, the currency converter widget. His widget took a long time to implement as it contained a large amount of code. He was able to include all the currencies by using a drop-down menu for both currency converted from to currency converted to. and he also had a hard time learning about the API and how to fetch the data but later on, he was able to implement it successfully and it was the third widget to be implemented.

Finally, Mohamad Bernar was able to include the fourth and final widget for the group this widget was about the Australian public holiday it contained a large amount of information, so he was able to simplify it by allowing the user to use a drop-down menu to choose the appropriate month. While this allowed the widget to look better and allow all the text to be contained within the widget boundary box, we all decided that it would look best if that widget was to take place on the right column. This allowed the site to look more organised and less cluttered.

We then worked on the aesthetics of the site, we decided to choose light colours such as pale turquoise, along with light blue and white background, thus we chose an easy-on-the-eye snowy mountain as a background and the header, which then we had to change the font colour, size, style along with the colour of the widgets to match the aesthetic of the website, we added white thin borders, and then rounded the widgets to give it a smoother and more sleek look rather than blocky boxes. We also worked on the spacing of the widgets to the blog post, and the sizeability and visibility of the website considering the viewpoint in order to avoid ugly white borders. 
We then added the final touches by editing the blog block to have the posts look better and changing the opacity to bring out the background more.

Then when it was ready we finally implemented the blog post creator, in order to create posts, only when logged in, we then centred it under the login information in order to create a better layout for the website, then allowed that after each post the page refreshes which brings out the updated blog post block.

# What did you find challenging: tell us what was hard about completing the project. This might be technical (understanding the API) or organisational (communication within the group). 

I believe what we found most challenging during our assignment, was firstly applying everything that we have learned during our weekly tutorials, we believe that the tutorials were a great help as it has given us the opportunity of applying the knowledge of our lecture slides & videos to our weekly workshop activities. We also greatly appreciate the guidance and help of our tutor Salma Khan, who provided great insight and guidance during the whole unit and specifically during our assignment, while allowing us to learn and understand the material she was able to help us whenever we were stuck on a task.

We had the most trouble during the blog post part of our assignment, being able to use the API endpoint along with navigating, researching and learning about the errors we kept facing in the console we were able to all work hard, troubleshoot and finally have it working before the due date.

# What was rewarding: one or two things that you were able to do that you feel contributed to your understanding of the content of this unit.

As mentioned above, what was rewarding is being able to use all our knowledge and everything we have learned throughout the unit to be able to build our own website with our own design and creativity. It was great to be able to work as a group and be able to communicate and collaborate effectively to have a website that is appealing and functional from start to finish. 
What greatly contributed to the unit in our opinion was that we were able to work individually by selecting and creating our own widgets, and then implementing them into the website to bring a finished product.

# Individual reflection: each team member should write one paragraph on their personal experience (include your name):
# which widget did you choose and why?
# what was the most challenging part of the project for you?

I ( Samer Almasri) chose the fact widget, while we were all looking at the possible widgets that we can implement and planning on what would our website have in the end, I was greatly drawn to the fact widget, I have always liked history and random facts, I find it very fascinating to be able to have accumulated knowledge on various topics and subjects, which can be used in conversations or as a general life knowledge which I will be able to use or implement in my daily life as a hack of some sort. I really liked the way that I am able to implement a widget that is able to grab the data from an API, and then match it to the day and monthâ€™s date then bring a fact that has happened on that same day. I found myself refreshing the page multiple times throughout the assignment just to read different interesting facts.
I believe the most challenging part of the project was the blog post part, it took me multiple tries along the way, also researching and looking up how to implement the API endpoint. I was able to scour the general discussion forum on iLearn to find out that someone has used the GitHub comp2110 web portal API documentation. After I was able to find that and access it, I was able to make sense of it and especially the user authorization token. I was adjusting the code along the way and it took a lot of changes as I was learning along the way. I found it very challenging to troubleshoot the console error codes but I am happy with the video that was given to us as a guide on iLearn. I have also helped a fellow student from the MACS discord by also pointing him to the documentation and he was able to work it out and he was very thankful!

When we brainstormed the design of the website, I (Alfarok Al Rahmani) was particularly captivated by the 'Weather Widget'. I was interested in this widget since meteorology has always been a subject that I find fascinating. Knowing that these weather patterns might affect our everyday choices makes it much more exciting for me to keep track of current climatic circumstances. The OpenWeatherMap API, in this example, is used by the weather widget to get live data from an API. You can get comprehensive weather predictions for Sydney, Australia, along with information on temperature and wind speed, in this data. A loading notice occurs when the page first loads while weather data is asynchronously fetched. 
As a result of some pieces straying outside the widget's limits, fitting all the content inside proved to be the most challenging task. This was a significant challenge since the widget's dense information weakened the design's focus and clarity. Nevertheless, by addressing the CSS style options, I was able to resolve this problem. I changed the overflow property to keep the elements within the widget and made sure the box-sizing was set to "border-box." By making a few changes to the padding and margins, I was able to ensure that all the content fit comfortably inside the widget, which enhanced the widget's overall look and usefulness.

The holiday widget was chosen by myself (Mohamad Bernar). I was linked to the holiday widget while we were deciding which widget to do. I figured that by making this widget, I'd have a good idea of how to make it creative and arrange it into a nice style. I was also intrigued by how this widget would interact with the API and how I would need to modify it to match our widget design. The API allows me to search for holidays from all around the world, but I choose to stay with Australian holidays because the others are unimportant to us. The most difficult element of my widget was probably arranging the dates into months and then placing them into a dropdown menu. However, after working through it and receiving assistance from my group and others, I was able to find help for this problem. I have learned a lot from this project and will be integrating this into the future of my coding career.
Creating a currency converter widget can be interesting because of its practicality. 

I (Ali Issa) was attracted to this widget as I'm interested in trading and thought a currency converter widget would be compelling. They're very useful for international travellers, online shoppers, business people dealing in foreign trade, or even students studying finance.
Implementing this widget helped me understand API integration. Developing a currency converter usually involves fetching real-time data from an external source, often via an API. APIs are a critical part of modern web and app development, and this project helped me understand how to integrate and use them effectively.
Currency conversion typically requires up-to-date exchange rates, and these are typically obtained via APIs. I had a performance issue, where If the widget is not properly optimised, constantly fetching data from the server slowed down the overall performance of the application. A really minor issue that I solved was designing such an interface, and making it responsive so it looks good on all possible screen sizes.
